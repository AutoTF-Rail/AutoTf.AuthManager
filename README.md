# AuthentikDashboard

This is a backend (includes front end(TBA)) for external authentik users to manage their profile and edit 2fa devices.

It includes all endpoints (TBA) that don't include the keywords "(for admins)" in the API docs of Authentik.

It's main purpose is as said to enable external users to enroll and delete 2fa devices without needing to be an internal user.


This API is mainly a side project (especially the Frontend), but the API is being used in [AutoTf.Manager](https://github.com/AutoTf-Rail/AutoTf.Manager).
